Key Features:
Modular Design: Structured to allow easy expansion and integration of new features.

Basic Functionality: Implements essential C# concepts such as OOP (Object-Oriented Programming), error handling, and data structures.

Prototype Purpose: Acts as a starting point for testing ideas before full-scale development.

Cross-Platform Potential: Can be extended using .NET Core/.NET for multi-platform support.

Possible Use Cases:
Proof of Concept (PoC) for a larger application.

Learning Tool for C# and .NET development.

Template Project for future applications with similar requirements.

This prototype can be further enhanced with features like database integration, API connectivity, or UI development (WPF, WinForms, or Blazor).
